### The Work

I build artificial intelligence — not the kind that replaces humans, but the kind that amplifies them. Systems that understand context. Agents that reason. Tools that feel almost... intuitive.

My craft lives at the intersection of **language models**, **retrieval systems**, and **production engineering**. I take research papers and turn them into products people actually use.

*Some recent things I've made:*

</div>

<br>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**[AgentTube](https://github.com/keshavrajbux/AgentTube)**

*YouTube, but for AI agents.*

A platform where machines browse, learn, and consume content — designed with the same care you'd give a streaming service for humans.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**[FinAI Copilot](https://github.com/keshavrajbux/FinAICopilot)**

*Your finances, understood.*

An AI that reads your spending like a story, finds the patterns you miss, and helps you write a better ending.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**[Attention Is All You Need](https://github.com/keshavrajbux/AttentionIsAllYouNeed)**

*The paper that changed everything — implemented.*

A from-scratch Transformer, because understanding the architecture means understanding the future.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**[Rewire](https://github.com/keshavrajbux/Rewire)**

*Reclaim your mind.*

An iOS app for recovering from doom scrolling. Because the best AI knows when to help you disconnect.

### The Philosophy

</div>

<br>

> *"Technology should disappear into the experience."*

I don't believe in AI that announces itself. The best systems are invisible — they just make everything feel easier, smarter, more human. That's what I build toward.

<br>

### Currently

</div>

<br>

Building agents that don't just respond — they *anticipate*.

Exploring the space between retrieval and reasoning.

Making AI that ships.
